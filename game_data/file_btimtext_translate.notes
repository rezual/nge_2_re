This is likely to be entirely in-battle dialogue.

It starts off with Misato and pilot dialogue that falls under the "Talk to pass the time" (退屈しのぎに何か話す) category. 
Misato has multiple versions of every basic question, and the pilots have various ways they can respond.

Lines 13 - 74 		Misato asking about the pilot's physical health (身体の調子), + responses
Lines 76 - 137    Misato asking about the state of the pilot's Eva, + responses
Lines 139 - ?293? Misato asking about the pilot's A.T. status (= emotional state), + responses

Lines 295 - 332 	Unsure
Lines 334 - 338		Dialogue of ?Ritsuko? advising pilots at beginning of the Bardiel fight.

Lines 340 - 518		More "Talk to the pass the time". Misato asking pilot what they think about a specific person, + responses. 

Lines 520 - 629		Lines addressing umbilical cable-related actions.
Lines 631 - 653		In-battle prompts from the game.

Lines 655 - 728		Correspond to pilot voice clips used during animations of Angels attacking. 
					        Despite being written out here, there is no dialogue box when these are used in-game.
Lines 730 - 797		Correspond to pilot voice clips used during animations of Evas attacking. 
					        Despite being written out here, there is no dialogue box when these are used in-game.
					
Lines 799 - 839 	Pilots announcing that they're boosting their A.T.F. to full power. 
                  Can't recall the in-game condition where this happens, so can provide no further comment at this time.

Lines 841 - END		Unsure. Kaworu seems to be the speaker, though.
