# Debug mode
So I've found a bunch of debug menus which can trigger various scenarios,
like making everyone want to use the bathroom at the same time.
(Remember, this game is The Sims meets RPG, so it has some sort of AI per character)

The debug menus will be helpful with the translation project,
allowing translations to be verified without having to play through the game.

## The approach
The way the debug menus were found was by having a script that'd relaunch the PPSSPP emulator ~20K times with a save-state, and each time forcing a jump to a different piece of code as if it was a menu function. I think people refer to these as variants of corruptors?

Since it's almost impossible to tell where a function starts in disassembly code, the patterns looked for to reduce search space was stuff like, is it decrementing sp, or is it right after the delay-slot of a jr ra?

After the emulator is launched, be a 1.5-second delay to trigger an in-emulator screenshot. Most attempts would crash the emulator (and not save a screenshot), some would yield interesting results. The search took about two days.

## Search for master continues
Sadly I couldn't find a "master" debug menu that links to all these little menus.
Also I've toggled one-off features like slow-motion or player position information before,
and I've not seen those exposed anywhere in the debug menus uncovered so far.

And based on the pieces of text like this, I'm sure the master debug menu must exist in there still:

    0x001D1438: Data(DataType.String, 20, '● Battle Play Start\0', "●戦闘プレイ開始\0"),
    0x001D144C: Data(DataType.String, 20, '● Battle Demo Test\0', "●戦闘デモテスト\0"),
    0x001D1460: Data(DataType.String, 16, '● Adjusted Play\0', "●調整プレイ\0"),
    0x001D1470: Data(DataType.String, 16, '● Demo Check\0', "●デモチェック\0"),
    0x001D1480: Data(DataType.String, 20, '● Debug Switch\0', "●デバッグスイッチ\0"),
    0x001D1494: Data(DataType.String, 20, '● Game Flag Settings\0', "●ゲームフラグ設定\0"),
    0x001D14A8: Data(DataType.String, 24, '● Hideaki Anno Mode Settings\0', "●庵野監督モード設定\0"),
    0x001D14C0: Data(DataType.String, 24, '● Display Test Menu\0', "●表示テストメニュー\0"),
    0x001D14D8: Data(DataType.String, 28, '● Event Test Menu\0', "●イベントテストメニュー\0"),
    0x001D14F4: Data(DataType.String, 24, '● Screen Test Menu\0', "●画面テストメニュー\0"),
    0x001D150C: Data(DataType.String, 24, '● Misc. Test Menu\0', "●その他テストメニュー\0"),
    0x001D1524: Data(DataType.String, 20, '● Misato 1 Day Vacation\0', "●ミサト１日やすみ\0"),
    0x001D1538: Data(DataType.String, 16, '● Option\0', "●オプション\0"),
    0x001D1548: Data(DataType.String, 12, '● Test\0', "●テスト\0"),

I _think_ I've tried to trace a while back what pieces of code reference the above lines,
and I don't recall finding any matching liu/adds/oris. I'll give it another try.

The game tends to use lots of dynamic jumps, so it's difficult to know what the parent function of the debug menu functions might be, since it's not a clear-cut `jal` instruction.

## The debug menus

After enabling cheats in PPSSPP,
and adding the code to PPSSPP's cheats folder `PPSSPP_folder\PSP\Cheats\ULJS00064.ini`,
and enabling the cheat in PPSSPP's cheat menu (press `Esc`, right side-bar if cheats are enabled),
then press triangle to activate it in-game.

The first couple of debug menus have lots of other sub-menus,
so definitely worth exploring.

I suggest using these on a PSP emulator,
since the menu selections tend to crash,
or some menus can't be exited without a reset.

Also, the debug menus don't pause the game,
so if a character interrupts with a new message box,
it'll "freeze/burn-in" the menu.

Finally, lots of the battle-mode menus can't be brought up in battle-mode
since I haven't looked into a button hook for it, yet.
