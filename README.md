# Neon Genesis Evangelion 2: Another Cases (PSP)
# Reverse Engineering & Translation

## Foreword
The translation is still a work in progress, and the tools are aimed at developers/translators,
and are not the tools the final patch user will ever need to use or install.
In its final form, the patch will be one or two files and a one-step apply process.

## Text Translation Status:
- Text in Game Executable located at `umd0:/PSP_GAME/SYSDIR/EBOOT.BIN`:
	- [x] 100.00% translated Writable sections - See patches/eboot_data.py
	- [ ] 62.74% translated Read-Only sections - See patches/eboot_rodata.py
- Conversation text: `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/game/imtext.bin`:
	- [ ] 0.00% translated (in total)
		- [ ] 0.00% translated - See patches/imtext_1.py
		- [ ] 0.00% translated - See patches/imtext_2.py
		- [ ] 0.00% translated - See patches/imtext_3.py
		- [ ] 0.00% translated - See patches/imtext_4.py
		- [ ] 0.00% translated - See patches/imtext_5.py
- Scripted event text (`.evs` files) located in various `.har` files: `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/`:
	- [ ] 12.09% translated (in total)
		- [ ] 16.07% translated - See patches/evs_1.py
		- [ ] 8.66% translated - See patches/evs_2.py
		- [ ] 11.55% translated - See patches/evs_3.py
- Battle mode text: `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/btl/btimtext.bin`:

	- [ ] 20.00% translated - See patches/f2tuto.py

## Image Translation Status
- Images with text:
	- [x] Pick all the images with text that need to be translated
	- [ ] Write up the text translations of the contents in the images
	- [ ] Modify images, removing text, replacing it with the background
	- [ ] Modify images, injecting text with proper font

## Reverse Engineering Status:
- [x] Unpack `.har` files
- [x] Decompress `.zpt` files/`.har` entries
- [x] Unpack WAVE `.bin` files
- [x] Unpack BIND `.bin` files
- [x] Modify/Repack `.har` files
- [x] Modify/Repack WAVE `.bin` files
- [x] Modify/Repack BIND `.bin` files
- [x] Export TEXT `.bin` files
- [x] Import/Patch TEXT `.bin` files
- [x] Export `.evs` files
- [x] Import `.evs` files
- [x] Import HGPT pictures 
- [x] Export HGPT pictures 
- [x] Patch `.evs` files
- [ ] Compress `.zpt` files/`.har` entries
- [ ] Write custom PSP CFW plugin to apply translation
	- Replace directly in memory translated text shorter than the original Japanese text (Easy)
	- Redirect assembly read/writes to other areas of memory for translated text longer than the original Japanese text (Hard)
- [ ] Wait for translators
- [ ] Release

## Project Folder Breakdown
- **game_app:** Contains the game disassembly as Python code.
	- app.py: Python summary of the decrypted EBOOT.bin information
	- section_data.py: Contains a listing of the read-writeable addresses within the game and descriptions
	- section_rodata.py: Contains a listing of the read-only addresses within the game and descriptions
	- section_text.py: The game disassembly
	- support.py: Support functions and classes for the above files
- **patches:** 
	-   `eboot_data.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the writable parts of the game code, in the  `umd0:/PSP_GAME/SYSDIR/EBOOT.BIN`  file
	    -   No method to apply yet
	-   `eboot_rodata.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the read-only parts of the game code, in the  `umd0:/PSP_GAME/SYSDIR/EBOOT.BIN`  file
	    -   No method to apply yet
	-   `f2info.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the text entries in the gameâ€™s Secret Information menu
	    -   Can be applied with:  `text.py --patch path_to_extracted_game/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/free/f2info.bin path_to_toolchain/patches/f2info.py`
	-   `f2tuto.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the text entries in the game's Tutorial menu
	    -   Can be applied with:  `text.py --patch path_to_extracted_game/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/free/f2tuto.bin path_to_toolchain/patches/f2tuto.py`
	-   `imtext_#.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the TEXT  `.bin`'s in the BIND  `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/game/imtext.bin`
	    -   The BIND  `.bin`  will need to be unpacked with  `tools/bind.py --unpack`  and then you can use  `text.py --patch`  to patch the resulting TEXT  `.bin`'s, followed by re-packing the files with  `tools/bind.py --repack`  again
	-   `btimtext.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the TEXT  `.bin`'s in the BIND  `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/btl/btimtext.bin`
	    -   The BIND  `.bin`  will need to be unpacked with  `tools/bind.py --unpack`  and then you can use  `text.py --patch`  to patch the resulting TEXT  `.bin`'s, followed by re-packing the files with  `tools/bind.py --repack`  again
	-   `evs_#.py`
	    -   Translation patches for the  `.evs`  scripts found in unpacked event  `.har`  files. They'll need to be patched with  `tools/evs.py` followed by re-injecting the patched  `.evs`  into the  `.har`  file using  `tools/hgar.py --replace-raw`
- **tools:**
	- `wave.py`: Pack/Unpack WAVE `.bin` files in: `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/voice/` 
	- `bind.py`: Pack/Unpack BIND `.bin` files, `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/game/imtext.bin` and `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/btl/btimtext.bin`
	- `text.py`: Export/Import/Patch TEXT `.bin` files, found in BIND `.bin` files after unpacking, and `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/free/f2tuto.bin` along with `umd0:/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/free/f2info.bin`
	- `hgar.py`: Unpack/Modify `.har` files. Uses `zipped.py` to decompress, but cannot recompress. Use `--replace-raw` to replace files & turn-off the compression bit, where-as `--replace` keeps the compression bit on.
	- `zipped.py`: Decompress `.zpt` files, and in the future, be able to recompress (WIP)
	- `hgpt.py`: Export/Import Pictures
	- `evs.py`: Export/Import Event Scripts
- **unused:** These files are no longer used but may be helpful to others

## Cheats:
These are the cheats made in the course of this project:

```
_C0 Pulse autowin
This disables player input in the Pulse mini-game
which is needed to prevent a crash from player input
interferring and then changes the Miss check to go
to a Win check
